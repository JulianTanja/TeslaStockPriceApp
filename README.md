# stockpriceapp

This stock price web app created with Streamlit is a very small side project I wrote in my free time in-between classes. 
It imports data from the yfinance Python library to display the closing price and volume of Tesla, Inc.'s stock (TSLA). 

To view the project, install Streamlit by using the following commands (if you're a Macbook user): 

pip install streamlit                                                                                         
streamlit hello

Afterwards, copy my code from the main1.py file to your IDE. 
To view the project on your browser, head to the Terminal and cd into the file's path directory. Then start Streamlit on your command line by typing: 

streamlit run main1.py 

Your browser should automatically show you the web application. If nothing happens, usually Streamlit will display a link similar to the command below 


 You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
